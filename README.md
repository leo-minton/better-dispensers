Better Dispensers
=================

Adds useful vanilla-like functionality to dispensers.
- Hoes can till land
- Goat horns can be blown
- Seeds and other bush-like blocks can be planted. (flowers, pink petals, etc.)
- If a dispenser has a dragon head attached to the front face, shot fire charges will become dragon fireballs.
